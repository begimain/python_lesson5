London near Victoria Station. Late one afternoon, when I was beginning to think that I
had worked enough for that day, I heard a ring at the bell. I opened the door to a total
stranger. He asked me my name; I told him. He asked if he might come in. "Certainly". 130
I led him into my sitting-room and begged him to sit down. He seemed a trifle embarrassed.
I offered him a cigarette and he had some difficulty in lighting it without letting go off
his hat. When he had satisfactorily achieved this feat I asked him if I should  not put it
on a chair for him. He quickly did this and while doing it dropped his umbrella.
"I hope you don't mind my coming to see you like this," he said.
"My name is Stephens and I am a doctor. You're in the medical, I believe?"
"Yes, but I don't practise."
"No, I know. I've just read a book of yours about Spain and I wanted to ask you about it."
"It's not a very good book, I'm afraid." "The fact remains that you know something about
Spain and there's no one else I know who does. And I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind
giving me some information." "I shall be very glad."
He was silent for a moment. He reached out for his hat and holding it in one hand absent-
mindedly stroked it with the other. I surmised that it gave him confidence.
"I hope you won't think it very odd for a perfect stranger to talk to you like this."
He gave an apologetic laugh. "I'm not going to tell you the story of my life."
When people say this to me I always know that it is precisely what they are going to do.
I do not mind. In fact I rather like it. "I was brought up my two old aunts. I've never
been anywhere. I've never done anything. I've been married for six years. I have no
children. I'm a medical officer at the Camberwell Infirmary. I can't stick it any more."
